### In this project I created a simple form for entering multiple passwords. Each time you enter an appropriate password, information will be displayed (in this case, information that the password has been accepted). The content of the message can be changed as well as passwords. For this purpose, it is necessary to change (inside constants) passwords and messages in the JS structure.

### password to check how the form works

### user
### name
